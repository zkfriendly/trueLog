2. Notable patterns:

    a. Jason Ian Green was the primary contributor during this period, often merged his own pull requests, and dealt primarily with choreography, version updates, fixes, and documentation. 

    b. Broken or incorrect documentation links were a recurring theme throughout this period, showing a focus on maintaining up-to-date, accurate documentation. 

    c. On a few occasions, decisions were made and then swiftly reversed; for instance, the 'Revert fast-uri change' commits. 

    d. There was a pattern of continuous integration, with regular updates and minor changes combined with careful tracking via issues and version control.
