Summary:

1. Key Changes and Features:
    - Support for Ubuntu Kinetic was removed due to deprecation (a16d757cd)
    - Upgraded goja in go.mod (509cd428e) 
    - Support restored for txlookuplimit flag in cmd/utils (68855216c)
    - Support for optional blob sidecar in BlobTx was added (2a6beb6a3)
    - Upgraded c-kzg-4844 in go.mod, build (e91b21ce2)
    - Duplication in eip2930 signer removed in core/types (80b76a952)
    - Release family switched to 1.13 in params to prep for PBSS (e2507a17e)
    - PBSS activated as an experimental feature (503f1f7ad)
    - Started v1.12.2 release cycle in params (d9a8b0ff7)
    - Go-ethereum v1.12.1 released under params (9c216bd6c)
    - Upgraded supranational/blst to 0.3.11 under deps (86d7f5aee)

2. Notable Patterns:
    - There is a consistent effort in code optimizations and refactoring like fixing typos, removing unused parameters, or refactoring filtering loops signifying commitment to maintain code quality.
    - Regular tests are being carried out to ensure code functionality, as seen in changes where tests have been added and tuned for performance.
    - Frequent upgrades are made to language versions and dependencies (go.mod with goja and c-kzg-4844, blst with supranational/blst).
    - Parameters are continuously adapted to cater to upcoming releases, and new experimental features are being activated.
    - Deprivation of software and features that aren't of use anymore plays a vital role in the development process; evident through ubuntu kinetic deprecation.
