1. Key Changes and Features:

   - An ancient flag was added to the db inspect in the geth command interface.
   - An issue with t9n intrinsicGas output was fixed by making it output in hex.
   - A sanitation process was introduced for max header and block history in the eth/gasprice functionality.
   - A "dev.gaslimit" flag was added for the geth command in dev mode.
   - Error messages were improved in freezer and EIP-2681 was implemented, limiting the account nonce to 2^64-1.
   - Modifications were made to the EVM command like changing intrinsicGas output to hexadecimal and renaming t8n result to match the types.Header, adding gasUsed to the t8n result.
   - The traceChain was updated to avoid OOM errors in long-running tracing.
   - The eth/tracers functionality was restructured and native 4byte and calltracer were made default.

2. Notable Patterns:

   - There are frequent minor fixes such as typos in comments, and file codes. This suggests that there is a focus on improving code readability and understandability.
   - There was a series of works on improving error messages and handling possible exceptions, indicating a focus on software reliability.
   - More efficient methods were introduced several times, suggesting an emphasis on optimization.
   - Several contributors have made significant impacts, but Martin Holst Swende stands out with frequent, varied, and significant contributions.
