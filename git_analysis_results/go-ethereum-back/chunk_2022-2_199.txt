1. Key changes and features:
   - Implementation of various Ethereum Improvement Protocols (EIPs): EIP-3651 (warm coinbase), EIP-1153 (transient storage).
   - Major bug fixes in the internal/web3ext relating to eth.call, and stateOverrides in the console. 
   - There have been updates in the tests, primarily to improve performance and avoid time-sensitivity in eth/catalyst.
   - There seems to be a lot of work on optimization including changes to freezer logic in core/rawdb, fsnotify replacing inotify in accounts/keystore, and improvements in metrics reading.
   - Updates on RPC to support HTTP headers injection and fix connection tracking set in the server.
   - Refactoring and cleaning of code, like the removal of untyped golang-lru and changes in the p2p/nat module to use IP.IsPrivate.
     
2. Notable patterns:
   - Multiple commits by the same author suggest ongoing projects or focused task. For instance, 'Felix Lange' has multiple entries showing work on rpc, debugging, and metrics.
   - Regular updating and fixing of test suites suggest a focus on maintaining quality and performance.
   - Several improvements suggest a focus on efficiency and performance, such as improvements in Go runtime metrics, readlimit on ethstats server connection, and update to Go 1.19 in Dockerfile.
   - There is also a noticeable recurrence of core and eth module modifications, showing a lot of activity in these areas.
