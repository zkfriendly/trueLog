1. Key changes and features: 
- The majority of the code changes were related to version updates (beginning the v1.10.5 release cycle and releasing go-ethereum v1.10.4 stable), updates to Docker, and tweaks to tests. There were also fixes to bugs and typos throughout the codebase. 
- The addition of DynamicFeeTx to the TxData implementation list was added in the docs. 
- A fix for potential nil pointer panic on test failure was implemented. 
- Several updates focused on EIP-1559 including the exposure of effectiveGasPrice in receipts, the support for eth_call invocations post 1559, and the enforcing of configured mining reward post 1559 too.
- On the testnet, London testnet blocks were added, and support for EIP-1559 transaction in clef was added.
- There was also support added for simulated reorgs and a stress test for EIP 1559.

2. Notable patterns: 
- Péter Szilágyi was the most active contributor during this period. 
- Several pull requests associated with EIP-1559 were merged.
- There were quite a few typo fixes indicating a fresh round of refactoring or perhaps a new style guide being followed.
- Many of the changes also revolved around fixing tests and improving test coverage which suggests an emphasis on increasing the stability and reliability of the codebase.
- The frequent updates to Docker suggest optimization of continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
