1. Key changes and features:
   - In terms of new capabilities, we have more tests for the EVM t8n (transaction) tool, and changes to the txpool to reject sudden alterations.
   - Several commits have an emphasis on observability and fine-tuning, with the addition of state metrics, a freezer batch write in rawdb, optimizations in slice/array encoding, addition of post-mortem documentation and relevant benchmarks.
   - As for housekeeping work, deprecated RPC flags and legacy features, such as eth/65 protocol and dependence on wallet backend packages, have been removed. The Dockerfile has been upgraded to Go 1.17, spelling mistakes and typos have been corrected, and additional copyright headers and audit links have been inserted.

2. Notable patterns:
   - Multiple developers are working across a wide range of functionality, indicating a collaborative, distributed development effort.
   - There is a strong focus on code quality, evidenced by numerous typo corrections, removal of deprecated flags and dependencies, and updates of important components like Go and golangci-lint.
   - Regular testing is also a prominent activity in the development process, with various changes for both the addition and optimization of tests.
