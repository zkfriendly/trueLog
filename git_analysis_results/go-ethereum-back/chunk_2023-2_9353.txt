1. Key changes and features:
   - Felix Lange integrated a more efficient use of "rlp.DecodeBytes" and fixed a 32-bit build. 
   - Marius van der Wijden implemented a refactor to improve the "getSealingBlock" method and updated the docker. He also optimized importChain to ignore the genesis block and reduced memory allocations in the recHash method.
   - Lightclient made changes to build blocks with EIP-4844 blobs, corrected forkID computation, and fixed unmarshalling of BlobTx values.
   - Martin Holst Swende committed multiple refactorings and bug fixes, notably related to the rawdb, Travis wait time and implementing EIP 4788 BeaconRoot.
   - Péter Szilágyi focused on eliminating irrelevant directives, fixing a startup issue, and exposing enhanced memory tracking among others.
   - Other various fix commits regarding things like named pipes, typos, replay operations, and timer dereferencing, among others.
   
2. Notable patterns:
   - The contribution of Felix Lange, Marius van der Wijden, and Martin Holst Swende is quite prolific during this period.
   - Many of the changes backend-related, improving code efficiency, reducing memory allocation, and fixing bugs.
   - There was a focus on Travis CI config updates, signalling an effort to improve the CI pipeline.
   - Ongoing work is visible towards EIP-based enhancements and optimizations reflecting an aim to upgrade the project in line with Ethereum Improvement Proposals.
