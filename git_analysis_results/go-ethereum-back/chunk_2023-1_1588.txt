1. Key changes and features:
   - Noteworthy improvements include enhanced metrics with the addition of traffic metrics to p2p/discover (commit f8f95346f by Exca-DK) and making gauge_float64 and counter_float64 lock free (commit b4dcd1a39 by Exca-DK).
   - A significant change involved switching to Pebble as the default database if none exists (commit d3ece3a07 by Péter Szilágyi).
   - Errors in code were fixed, as shown by the fixing of a discrepancy in receipt.EffectiveGasPrice json encoding tags (commit f8aa62353 by Roberto Bayardo).
   - The codebase was updated to use atomic types multiple times (commits 306d17749, 25f9977f2, f541cad27, ae93e0b48, 3768b0074 by Stephen Guo, s7v7nislands and others).
   - Significant refactoring took place for trie API (commit 99f81d272 by rjl493456442).
   - Notable improvements also include the orderly arrangement of opcodes (commit 3f7afc3f5 by Alex Beregszaszi) and measures to disallow future churn by remote transactions (commit 230df98e4 by Marius van der Wijden).

2. Notable patterns:
   - There's a general focus on refining existing code with small, incremental fixes and improvements (for example, typo fixes, optimization using atomic types).
   - A frequent concept is the modifications and updates to the "eth/tracers" and "p2p/discover", suggesting a focus on network behavior and transaction tracing during this period.
   - Several commits indicate a commitment to cleaning up the code, both by removing unneeded code and reorganizing for efficiency and clarity.
   - Code refactoring and cleaning up are commonly repeated themes, suggesting that this period had a focus on improving the code's maintainability.
