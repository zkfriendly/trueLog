1. Key changes and features:
   - A substantial number of changes done mainly by Martin Holst Swende, notably in the "params" and "build" sections, some of which includes beginning the v1.10.18 release cycle and updating to golangci-lint v1.45.2.
   - Marius van der Wijden worked on "core" and "eth" sections including the implementation of Kiln-v2 spec and fixing log messages in eth/catalyst.
   - Péter Szilágyi handled a range of pull requests and fixed an off-by-one error in a test resulting in a 50% failure rate. Also, the Go version was updated to 1.18.
   - There were further changes to core and eth sections by other contributors, including: adding features like additional include paths to the solidity compiler, adding refund to the StructLogRes, and cleanups in the generation code.
   
2. Notable patterns:
   - There is a clear emphasis on refining and troubleshooting the already implemented code. This is seen as many changes involve minimal enhancements and typo corrections in comments, improving test robustness, and optimizing code performance.
   - Focused updates on "core", "eth", and "build" areas. These could be central components needing regular updates.
   - Major contributors are Martin Holst Swende, Péter Szilágyi, and Marius van der Wijden, who have done most of the code reviews and pull request merges as well as actual coding.
   - A few commits were related to staging releases for Go Ethereum (v1.10.17 stable, begin v1.10.18 release cycle).
   - The time difference in the logs suggests contributors are from different time zones, indicating a decentralized team.
