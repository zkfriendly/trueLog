1. Key changes and features: In this period, there were several key updates including the addition of test cases and minor bug fixes to accounts/abi by Marius van der Wijden, updates to node-related HTTP servers by Steven E. Harris, and fixes to shutdown regression in eth by Péter Szilágyi. Further, modifications were made to p2p/enode code comment, fixes applied to binary iterator in core/state/snapshot, and an initial implementation for range proof was conducted in trie, among other updates.

2. Notable patterns: A recurring theme in this period is the fixing of bugs across various modules such as accounts/abi, node, eth, core/state/snapshot, and more. Péter Szilágyi seems to be frequently involved, both in individual commits and merges. Multiple updates were made in the same areas like accounts/abi and core/state/snapshot, indicating focused efforts on these components. There are also version update commits (Geth v1.9.13 start and finish, Go to 1.14.2), showing the progress of the codebase.
