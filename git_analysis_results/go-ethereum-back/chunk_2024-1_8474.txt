1. Key changes and features:

   - Various fixes and improvements were introduced like a typo correction, genesis difficulty, usage of a different function for error generation, pathing, improved error information for vm errors, and Godoc comments.
   - There's a replacement of different methods with `slices.Contains` and `maps.Clone` across multiple modules.
   - Upgrades were made with the Go version in the build process.
   - Additional features include the implementation of blob transactions, enforcing fork order in beacon types; atomic types in caches, and introducing metrics to track inbound and outbound peers.

2. Notable patterns:

   - There's a consistent effort by the contributor 'cui' to replace existing methods with `slices.Contains`, `maps.Clone`, and `atomic.Pointer`.
   - Contributor 'Aaron Chen' has also been involved in multiple updates where he used `slices.Contains`.
   - The team has been focusing on improving error handling and optimizing the code by using more efficient methods/functions across different modules.
