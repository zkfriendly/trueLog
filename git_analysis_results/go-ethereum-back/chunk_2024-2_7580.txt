1. Key changes and features:
   - Significant effort was dedicated to code clean-up, including removing dead code, redundant features and dependencies (commits by Péter Szilágyi).
   - Several fixes and updates were made to core, eth, and beacon/engine functionalities, including adjustments to system call tracing, memory usage during reorg, and adding new API features in the beacon/engine (commits by numerous authors).
   - Crypto module and security policies were updated (commits by Fredrik Svantes, Shude Li, kevaundray).
   - Changes to improve testing, building, and performance, such as enabling concurrent building for arm64, adding Ubuntu 24.10 support, and updating golangci-lint version (commits by Roman Krasiuk, Felix Lange, Hteev Oli, and Martin HS).

2. Notable patterns:
   - Péter Szilágyi was a prominently active contributor within this period.
   - A clear pattern towards streamlining dependencies graph, probably to promote better system design and higher code reliability.
   - Several commits focused on optimizing performance and enhancing usability, showing sustained commitment to improving user experience and system efficiency.
   - Increased focus on updating documentation and security policies, suggesting an emphasis on maintaining secure and well-documented codebases.
   - Multiple updates and bug fixes on 'eth/tracers' and 'beacon/engine' imply high activity and feature expansion in those areas.
