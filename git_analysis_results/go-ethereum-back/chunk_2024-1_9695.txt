1. Key changes and features:
    - Multiple fixes were implemented, ranging from typos in documents, code, and fixing flaky tests, as well as specific bug fixes (e.g. in eth_fillTransaction, eth_feeHistory, miner tip enforcement).
    - A few updates including support for blob transactions, updating block index format, beginning new release cycles, adding a 'help' target in the Makefile.
    - Some optimizations were added, like minor uint256 related perf improvements and cache transaction index in memory.
    - Ubuntu 'lunar' build was removed and several outdated links were updated.
    - Dropped support for eth/67 and implemented 'export-history' subcommand.

2. Notable Patterns:
    - Majority of the updates were handled by core members in the Git repository, with Martin Holst Swende initiating new release cycles for go-ethereum program.
    - The typo fixes and documentation updates were widespread across different modules implying a high standard for code clarity and readability.
    - 'fix' and 'update' are recurrent themes, suggesting an ongoing active maintenance with an emphasis on stability and performance.
    - The project seems to be moving towards a new release, hence there is a mix of minor fixes and newly implemented features.
