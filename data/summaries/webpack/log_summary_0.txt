[description]
This project is webpack, a static module bundler for JavaScript applications. The analyzed commit logs reveal active development focused on performance improvements, bug fixes, type enhancements, new features related to CSS Modules and CSS handling, experimental features like module execution at build time and asynchronous WebAssembly loading, and improvements to Module Federation.  Dependency updates and tooling upgrades are also frequent.

[milestones]
• CSS Modules Support
    - Implemented basic support for CSS Modules, including local ident name generation, :local/:global functions, :export blocks, and vendor prefix handling.
    - Added `url()`, `@import`, `image-set()`, `@layer`, `@property` support within CSS Modules.
    - Allowed default and named exports in CSS Modules.
    - Introduced `css/auto` type to automatically decide between pure CSS and CSS Modules based on filename.
• Improved CSS Handling
    - Added support for `fetchPriority` and `__webpack_nonce__` for CSS chunks.
    - Allowed customization of the BannerPlugin stage.
    - Implemented CSS imports rendering and `@value` support in CSS Modules.
    - Added CSS tokenizer according to spec.
    - Improved parsing of URLs and `@import` in CSS.
• Module Federation Enhancements
    - Improved consumption of eager shared modules.
    - Added container hoisting plugin.
    - Fixed consumption of eager shared modules and hoisting of container references.
• Experimental Features
    - Introduced `experiments.buildHttp` for build-time HTTP requests.
    - Added `experiments.executeModule` for module execution at build time.
    - Added new external type "module-import" to use import for external modules.
• Performance Optimizations
    - Optimized `FlagDependencyExportsPlugin` for large JSON.
    - Improved performance of `JsonExportsDependency` cache.
    - Optimized chunk graph creation.
    - Optimized `RemoveParentModulesPlugin` via bigint arithmetic.
    - Optimized `numberHash` and `compareStringsNumeric` functions.
• Improved Error Handling and Reporting
    - Improved auto public path detection and added DOM clobbering protection.
    - Improved error messages for various scenarios, including CSS runtime errors and module resolution.
    - Added a warning for async external modules.

[patterns]
