[description]
Webpack, a module bundler for JavaScript applications.

[milestones]
• Persistent Caching
    - Implemented a persistent caching mechanism to speed up builds by storing and reusing build artifacts. Includes options for cache management and logging.
• Build Dependencies Tracking
    - Added tracking of build dependencies to ensure correct cache invalidation and rebuilds, improving build reliability.
• Enhanced Configuration Validation
    - Improved validation of webpack configurations using schemas, providing more informative error messages and preventing misconfigurations.
• Runtime Modules Refactoring
    - Refactored runtime code into separate modules, improving code organization and enabling more efficient runtime execution.
• Logging Enhancements
    - Introduced a new logging API and improved logging throughout the compiler, providing more detailed and configurable output for build analysis and debugging.
• Deterministic Module IDs
    - Implemented deterministic module IDs for better long-term caching, simplifying cache management and improving build reproducibility.
• Support for Top-Level Await and Async Modules
    - Added experimental support for top-level await and async modules, enabling more modern JavaScript features.
• Removal of Deprecated APIs
    - Removed various deprecated APIs and plugins, streamlining the codebase and encouraging the use of newer, more efficient alternatives.
• Migration to Jest for Testing
    - Migrated from Mocha to Jest for testing, improving test performance and using snapshot testing.
• Improved Progress Plugin
    - Enhanced the ProgressPlugin to provide more detailed and customizable progress reporting during builds, aiding in build analysis.
