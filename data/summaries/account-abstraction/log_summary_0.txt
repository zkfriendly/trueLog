[description]
This project implements ERC-4337, a standard for account abstraction in Ethereum. The commit logs track its development from initial contract creation to a more mature state, including core contracts, sample implementations, testing, and deployment scripts.  The project aims to improve the user experience and security of Ethereum accounts.

[milestones]
• Account Abstraction (ERC-4337) Implementation
    - Core contracts: EntryPoint, BaseAccount, Paymasters
    - Sample implementations: SimpleAccount, TokenPaymaster, BLSAccount
    - RPC methods for bundlers and users
    - Gas optimization and validation rules
• ERC-7562 (Reputation System)
    - Introduction of reputation rules and updates to the specification
• Security Audits and Bug Fixes
    - Addressing vulnerabilities and improving code quality based on audit reports
• Tooling and Testing Improvements
    - Introduction of gas testing, simulations, and linting
• Code Refactoring and Cleanup
    - Removal of unused code, improved code organization, and consistent naming conventions
• Deployment Scripts and Deployment on Testnets
    - Automation of contract deployments


[patterns]
• Iterative Development based on Audit Feedback
    - Numerous commits address specific audit findings (e.g., L-01 to L-14, N-01 to N-14, H-01 to H-10).
    - Impact: Enhanced security and robustness of the implementation.
• Focus on Gas Optimization
    - Recurring theme of gas optimization commits (e.g., "gas-optimize deposit", "Pack gas fees").
    - Impact: Reduced transaction costs for users.
• Evolution of UserOperation Structure
    - Changes in UserOperation fields and packing strategies (e.g., "Packing UserOperation and paymaster gas limits").
    - Impact: Improved efficiency and flexibility of UserOperations.
• Development of Supporting Infrastructure
    - Creation of RPC methods, debugging tools, and simulations.
    - Impact: Easier integration and development for bundlers and wallet developers.
• Transition from Wallet to Account Terminology
    - Consistent renaming of "wallet" to "account" across the codebase.
    - Impact: Alignment with the ERC-4337 terminology.
• Refinement of Validation and Bundling Rules
    - Several updates to validation rules and bundling logic for security and consistency.
    - Impact: More secure and predictable account behavior.
• Code Quality Improvements through Linting and Cleanup
    - Introduction of linting and commits addressing code style and unused code.
    - Impact: Improved maintainability and readability of the codebase.
