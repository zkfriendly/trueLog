[description]
EthereumJS monorepo project focusing on core Ethereum functionalities implemented in JavaScript. Packages include components for VM execution, blockchain management, transaction processing, peer-to-peer networking, consensus mechanisms, and utility functions.

[milestones]
• Verkle Tree Implementation
    - Introduced verkle tree structure and functionalities in the `verkle` package.
    - Implemented verkle proof verification.
    - Integrated verkle stateful execution within the client.
    - Various verkle fixes and optimizations.
• Ethereum Client Development
    - Implemented snap sync and associated fetchers for storage, bytecode, and trie nodes.
    - Implemented new engine API methods for Shanghai and Cancun hardforks.
    - Improved client syncing stability and performance.
    - Added support for Holesky and Kaustinen testnets.
    - Implemented various RPC methods, including debug_traceTransaction and debug_traceCall.
• Transaction Processing Improvements
    - Refactored transaction capabilities and added a generic transaction interface.
    - Implemented EIP-7702 (withdrawal requests) and EIP-4895 (beacon chain withdrawals).
    - EIP-4844 implementation (blobs).
    - Added support for EIP-1559 transactions.
• State Management Enhancements
    - Introduced stateful and stateless verkle state managers.
    - Refactored and optimized storage caching within the state manager.
• Code Refactoring and Dependency Management
    - Trie package renamed to `mpt`.
    - Migrated from BN.js to BigInt for number representation.
    - Upgraded Typescript to v5.
    - Migrated from JSON to JS test data.
    - Removed and replaced various dependencies.
    - Improved code documentation and added debugging tools.
    - Addressed technical debt through refactoring and code cleanup.
