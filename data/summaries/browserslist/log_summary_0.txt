Browserslist is a tool that allows developers to specify the browsers they want to support in their web projects.  It uses a flexible query syntax to target browsers based on usage statistics, release dates, or specific versions.  It is integrated into various build tools and helps optimize website performance by only including necessary polyfills and CSS prefixes.
