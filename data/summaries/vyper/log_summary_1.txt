Vyper, a Pythonic smart contract language. This commit log chronicles its evolution from initial implementation to beta releases, highlighting key features, improvements, and bug fixes.

[milestones]
• Implemented named structs
• Added support for constants and constant folding
• Introduced the `convert` function for type conversions, deprecating older methods
• Implemented private functions and private function calls with argument passing
• Added support for default function arguments
• Implemented event logging with support for various data types, including bytes arrays
• Developed a debugger (vdb)
• Added support for custom units in variables and functions
• Introduced the `vyper-serve` command for compiling Vyper code via JSON interface
• Added support for binary literals and improved bytes array handling
• Implemented integer division and removed implicit conversion for arithmetic operations
• Introduced block scoping for `if` statements and `for` loops
• Renamed the project from Viper to Vyper
• Released beta versions of Vyper (0.1.0-beta.1 through 0.1.0-beta.4)

[patterns]
• Continuous improvement of type handling and safety
    - Introduction of `convert` function, stricter type checking, custom unit support, overflow protection, removal of implicit conversions.
    - Reduced type-related errors and improved code clarity.
• Focus on gas optimization
    - Optimized LLL generation for various operations, improved gas estimation, and reduced gas costs for private functions.
    - Resulted in more efficient smart contracts.
• Enhanced developer experience
    - Introduction of `vyper-serve`, vdb, improved error messages, clear documentation updates, and standardized code formatting.
    - Streamlined development and debugging processes.
• Incremental feature additions
    - Step-by-step implementation of features like constants, private functions, default arguments, events, bytes array handling, etc.
    - Allowed for thorough testing and refinement of each feature.
• Active community contributions
    - Numerous pull requests addressing bug fixes, documentation updates, examples, and new features.
    - Enhanced the project's development pace and robustness.
• Addressing technical debt
    - Refactoring of parser, removal of unnecessary dependencies, and cleanup of old code.
    - Improved maintainability and reduced code complexity.
