[description]
A command-line argument parser library. This project is the `clap-rs` command-line argument parser. The commit logs span from initial commit to March 2021 and cover a wide range of changes, including feature additions, bug fixes, documentation improvements, performance optimizations, and refactoring.

[milestones]
• Dynamic Completion Engine Overhaul: Introduced a dynamic completion engine, allowing for customized completions based on shell context. Added support for more shells beyond Bash, including Zsh, Fish, Elvish, PowerShell, and Nushell. Deprecated the old static completion system.
• Improved Help and Usage Output: Help messages were made more concise and consistent. Added support for styling help output using ANSI codes. Allowed flattening subcommand help and usage for simpler display. Implementation of a new templated help system. Introduced template tags for customization. Added `before_help` and `after_help` to App.
• Enhanced Value Parsing and Validation: Introduced the ValueParser trait for customized value parsing. Implemented support for various value types, including paths, numbers, and enums. Improved error messages for invalid values. Introduction of `Arg::case_insensitive` for case-insensitive matching of possible values. Implementation of `Arg::require_delimiter` for enforcing value delimiters. Support for conditionally required arguments (`required_if`, `required_unless`, etc.).
• ArgGroup Enhancements: Added APIs for accessing and managing grouped arguments. Improved error handling for ArgGroups with default values. Arg Indices: Ability to query argument value indices.
• Performance and Code Size Optimizations: Reduced allocations and improved build times. Removed several dependencies. Switched to more efficient string types internally. Overhaul of multiple value handling with enhancements for number of values, terminators, and delimiters.
• Transitioned to Edition 2021: Updated to Rust Edition 2021.
• Breaking Changes in Version 4.0.0: Removed deprecated APIs, including those related to SubCommand, possible_values, and several ArgSettings methods. Renamed several types and functions for consistency and clarity, such as App to Command. Support for generating Bash and PowerShell completion scripts at compile time. YAML configuration support. Added the ability to define arguments, groups, and settings in YAML files.
  
[patterns]
• Iterative Development and Refinement: Many commits focus on improving specific aspects of the API, error handling, or help output based on user feedback and bug reports. Iterative improvement of help and usage messages. Consistent focus on clarity and user experience. Numerous adjustments in formatting, wrapping, and content.
• Focus on Backwards Compatibility: Several milestones involve deprecating old APIs rather than removing them outright, providing migration paths for users. Gradual deprecation of older APIs and methods shows a commitment to maintaining a clean and consistent API.
• Performance Awareness: Recurring theme of optimizing for speed and reducing code size. Ongoing refactoring and code cleanup. Regular use of `clippy` and `rustfmt`. Focus on code deduplication and performance optimization.
• Community Contributions: Many improvements and bug fixes are contributed by the community. Active contribution and community involvement. Frequent pull requests and feedback from various contributors.
• Extensive Testing: Commits frequently include tests for new features, bug fixes, and UI changes. Proactive bug fixing and addition of comprehensive tests demonstrate a focus on code correctness and robustness.
• Documentation Improvements: Significant effort towards improving documentation and examples, particularly in the derive and tutorial sections.
• Use of Unstable Features: Use of unstable feature flags to experiment with new functionality and APIs before stabilization.
• Potential Technical Debt: Unstable features, while useful for experimentation, can create technical debt if not carefully managed and stabilized or removed when appropriate. Some early design decisions required significant refactoring to support new features or improve performance, suggesting potential accumulation of technical debt over time. Potential technical debt indicators with internal refactoring cycles to clean code duplication and streamline internal APIs. This might indicate evolving internal designs.
• Increasing use of macros for code generation and API simplification: Examples include `clap_app!`, `arg_enum!`, `value_t!`. Growing support for external configuration (YAML) reflects a shift towards more declarative CLI definitions.
