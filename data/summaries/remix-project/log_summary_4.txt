Remix IDE, a browser-based Solidity IDE. This commit log reflects a period of significant refactoring, feature implementation, and UI/UX improvements.

[milestones]
• Refactoring of core components
    - Moved modules into logical folders (e.g., runtime, editor, execution).
    - Refactored UI elements to use classes and improve organization.
    - Separated UI from logic in the Universal DApp module.
• Plugin Framework Introduction
    - Added basic plugin API and support for loading/unloading plugins.
    - Introduced example plugins (e.g., Etherscan network status).
• Remixd Integration
    - Improved integration with remixd for local file access.
    - Enhanced error handling and feedback in remixd interactions.
• Testing Improvements
    - Added more unit and browser tests.
    - Introduced remix-tests for easier contract testing.
• UI/UX Enhancements
    - Redesigned the run tab and debugger UI.
    - Added copy buttons for ABI and bytecode.
    - Implemented theme switching.
    - Improved the terminal interface.
• Solidity Compiler Updates
    - Updated Solidity compiler versions.
    - Added support for multiple compilers.
    - Improved compilation error handling and feedback.
• Static Analysis Improvements
    - Added static analysis modules (e.g., selfdestruct warnings, unassigned variables).
    - Improved static analysis messages and reporting.
• New Features
    - Added support for signing messages.
    - Implemented a recorder for transactions.
    - Added a context menu.
    - Improved Solidity variable decoding in the debugger.
