Remix IDE is a browser-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) primarily for Solidity smart contract development, but with growing support for other languages like Vyper, Circom, and Cairo.  The project focuses on feature development, testing, refactoring, UI/UX improvements, and external library updates.  Key areas of development include plugin architecture, AI integration, debugging enhancements, and support for multiple networks and providers.
