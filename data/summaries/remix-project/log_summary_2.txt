[patterns]
• Shift towards React
    - Many modules were rewritten in React. This suggests a deliberate move to modernize the frontend and improve maintainability.
• Increased focus on testing
    - Improvements and bug fixes in E2E tests, debugger tests, and other suites indicate a growing emphasis on code quality and stability.
    - Splitting of E2E tests suggests a concern about CI pipeline speed.
• Addressing technical debt
    - Refactoring of core plugins, like the file manager, addresses technical debt and prepares the project for future development.
    - Linting fixes throughout the codebase improve code quality and consistency.
• Focus on user experience
    - UI/UX improvements like dragbar, scroll fixes, and tooltip enhancements suggest a focus on user experience.
• Growing plugin ecosystem
    - Support for new languages and tools via plugins indicates a desire to cater to a broader range of development needs.
• Iterative bug fixing
    - Numerous small bug fixes and UI tweaks indicate an iterative approach to development with responsiveness to user feedback.
