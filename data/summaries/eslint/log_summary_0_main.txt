ESLint, a pluggable JavaScript linting utility. This project focuses on improving developer experience by enhancing error messages, refining rules, improving performance, and expanding support for new language features and frameworks.  Significant effort is dedicated to documentation updates and maintaining compatibility.  A major version 9 release introduces breaking changes related to flat config, rule metadata, Node.js version support, and removal of deprecated context methods and formatting rules.
