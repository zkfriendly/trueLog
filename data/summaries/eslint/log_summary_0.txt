[Description]
ESLint is a pluggable JavaScript linting utility focused on improving code quality, consistency, and developer experience.  Development efforts have consistently addressed bug fixes, new rule implementation, documentation improvements, performance optimizations, and adaptation to evolving JavaScript standards like ES6 and beyond (including JSX and TypeScript).  Major version releases (like v9) often introduce breaking changes related to core architecture (e.g., flat config), rule metadata, and dependency updates (Node.js versions).

[Milestones]
New Rules & Enhancements:  A continuous stream of new rules and enhancements to existing rules addressing code style, potential errors, and best practices. Examples include: `function-paren-newline`, `semi-style`, `no-unused-vars`, `no-implicit-coercion`, `no-constant-binary-expression`, `no-loss-of-precision`, `no-unneeded-ternary`, `object-shorthand`, and many more.  Rules also received updates for better error messages, suggestions, autofixing capabilities, and options for finer control.
Architectural Changes:  Significant refactoring of core components like `Linter`, `RuleTester`, `SourceCode`, and `CLIEngine`, often involving conversion to ES6 classes and improved APIs.  A major shift to flat config in v9 simplified configuration and improved performance.
ES6, JSX, and TypeScript Support:  Progressive integration and improvement of support for ES6 features, JSX syntax, and TypeScript. This includes dedicated environments, rule updates, and enhanced parser compatibility.  TypeScript support further evolved with TS config file integration and improved type definitions within ESLint itself.
Performance Improvements:  Ongoing efforts to optimize performance in various areas, including the `SourceCode` constructor, autofixing, rule processing (e.g., `no-multiple-empty-lines`, `indent`), configuration loading, and leveraging tools like `v8-compile-cache`.
Documentation Updates:  Continuous improvement and expansion of documentation, including rewriting rule descriptions, migrating to a new documentation site with improved navigation and search, and adding comprehensive documentation for core APIs and features.
Tooling and Build System Enhancements:  Improvements to internal tooling, including fuzzers, performance benchmarks, and migration from Jake to Grunt.  Implementation of automated tests for core rules, features, and autofixing.
Deprecations and Removals:  Deprecated rules are regularly removed and replaced with more modern alternatives. Deprecated context methods and formatting rules were removed in v9.
Configuration Enhancements:  Improvements to configuration handling, including glob-based configs, overrides, caching, and merging, providing more flexibility and customization.
CLI Enhancements:  New CLI options like `--init`, `--stdin-filename`, and `--quiet` improve usability and developer experience.
