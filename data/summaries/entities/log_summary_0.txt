• Performance optimization
    - Introduction of trie data structure for encoding/decoding. Demonstrates concern for performance.
• Security consciousness
    - Regular security updates via Dependabot.
    - Adoption of stricter CI practices.
• Continuous improvement
    - Incremental updates and bug fixes. Regular releases suggest an active and responsive development cycle.
• Automation
