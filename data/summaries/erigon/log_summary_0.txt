[description]
Erigon, an Ethereum client, undergoes continuous development with a focus on performance, efficiency, and Polygon integration. This commit log reflects work on RPC methods, database optimization, Caplin integration, and bug fixes related to snapshots and data synchronization.

[milestones]
• Caplin Integration
    - Added support for beacon snapshots and lightclient server.
    - Implemented various Beacon API endpoints for validators, rewards, and duties.
    - Optimized attestation and block processing in Caplin.
    - Integrated Caplin with OtterScan and MDBX database.
    - Added block production capabilities to Caplin.
• Erigon 3.0 Development
    - Implemented EIP-7702 (set code tx), EIP-7685/6110 (requests), EIP-2935 (historical block hashes), and EIP-2537 (BLS12-381).
    - Transitioned to a new history data model with KVS iterators.
    - Removed Proof-of-Work consensus code.
    - Optimized state and snapshot handling, including pruning and merging.
    - Improved RPC methods, particularly around tracing and logs.
    - Upgraded various dependencies and libraries.
• Polygon Integration
    - Implemented a new Polygon sync stage, integrated bridge logic, and improved error handling.
    - Added support for fetching headers, bodies, and spans from Heimdall.
    - Implemented validators set snapshot computation in bor_heimdall stage.
    - Optimized Bor and Heimdall synchronization and data handling.
• Downloader Improvements
    - Enhanced webseed handling, added support for tokens and manifests, and improved error messages.
    - Implemented atomic operations for torrent files and optimized download rates.
    - Added verification and re-download capabilities.
• Database Optimization
    - Implemented various performance improvements and bug fixes related to MDBX.
    - Added support for managing dirty space, pruning tables, and compressing values.
    - Optimized inverted indices, history ranges, and domain ranges.

[patterns]

• Erigon 3.0 Transition
    - Ongoing work towards Erigon 3.0, with code refactoring, dependency upgrades, and new feature implementation.
    - Impact: Preparing for the next major version of Erigon.
• Polygon Integration Refinement
    - Continuous improvement of Polygon synchronization and data handling, addressing bug fixes and edge cases.
    - Impact: More robust and efficient Polygon support.
• Increased Testing
    - Focus on adding unit tests, integration tests, and QA tests, along with improved testing infrastructure.
    - Impact: Enhanced code quality and reliability.
• Technical Debt Management
    - Removal of deprecated code, simplification of complex logic, and addressing technical debt accumulated in earlier versions.
    - Impact: Improved maintainability and codebase health.
