[description]
Erigon, an Ethereum client, undergoes significant development and bug fixing, including performance optimization, refactoring, support for new hard forks and EIPs, updates to dependencies and test infrastructure, and introduction of experimental features like Erigon3 and Caplin.

[milestones]
• Erigon3 (E3) Development
    - Introduction of a new storage engine with incremental reconstitution, parallel execution, and aggressive pruning.
    - Implementation of `eth_getLogsV3`, `eth_traceTransaction`, and other RPC methods using iterators.
    - Development of a key-value temporal store.
• Caplin (CL) Integration
    - Implementation of Caplin, a consensus layer light client, with support for gossip, state transition, and various optimizations.
    - Refactoring and separation of consensus from the execution engine.
• EIP-4844 and 4788 Support
    - Implementation of EIP-4844 (Shard Blob Transactions) related changes in transaction pool, receipts, and block execution.
    - Implementation of EIP-4788 (Beacon Block Root in the EVM) support, including RPC methods and fork choice updates.
• Erigon-lib Development
    - Movement of common utilities and data structures to the `erigon-lib` subdirectory for improved code organization and reusability.
• Refactoring and Performance Optimizations
    - Several refactoring efforts across different modules, like transaction pool and snapshots, for improved performance and reduced allocations.
    - Implementation of read-ahead and other optimization strategies.
• Tooling and Infrastructure Improvements
    - Development of a devnet tool for testing and simulation.
    - Updates to the testing infrastructure, including new tests and benchmarking.
    - Introduction of new CLI commands for database backup and snapshot management.
• Logging Improvements
    - Introduction of separate log files for different modules and improved log verbosity controls.
• Dependency Updates
    - Updates to several dependencies, including gRPC, libp2p, and Prometheus.
• Support for new Chains and Forks/Updates to existing ones
    - Holesky, Cancun, Shapella, Capella, Prague, Shanghai, Bellatrix, Altair, Gibbs, Moran, Indore, Delhi
    - Sepolia, Goerli, Rinkeby, Mumbai, Chiado, Gnosis Chain, Mainnet (ETH), BSC, Polygon
• Bug Fixes
    - Numerous bug fixes addressing issues in body downloader, tracing, snapshots, RPC methods, txpool, and other components.
