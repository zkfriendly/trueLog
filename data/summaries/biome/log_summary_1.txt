[description]
Rome is a linter, compiler, bundler, and more for JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, JSON, Markdown, and CSS.

[milestones]
• Initial Release of Rome Formatter (0.6.0)
    - Basic formatting capabilities for JavaScript and TypeScript.
    - Support for JSX and TSX formatting.
    - Prettier compatibility metrics and tests.
• Linter and CLI Enhancements
    - Implementation of numerous lint rules (e.g., no-unused-variables, no-shadow, etc.) across various languages.
    - Introduction of rule groups and severity levels.
    - Extensible `declare_rule` macro for custom rule creation.
    - Code actions for lint fixes (e.g., `inlineVariable`).
    - CLI commands for linting (`check`, `ci`) and code fixing (`--apply-suggested`).
• Language Server and VS Code Extension
    - Development of a Language Server Protocol (LSP) server.
    - Integration with VS Code for diagnostics, code actions, and formatting.
    - Status bar item for LSP.
• Playground Development
    - Creation of a playground for interactive experimentation with Rome features.
    - AST visualization and control flow graph display.
• Core Infrastructure and Performance Improvements
    - Refactoring of diagnostics to use markup.
    - Replacement of the system allocator with mimalloc on Windows.
    - Optimization of code action diff generation and formatter source map performance.
• Parsing Enhancements
    - Introduction of the `rome_rowan` crate for AST manipulation.
    - Development of a JSX parser and error recovery mechanism.
    - Support for parsing various TypeScript syntax constructs.
• CSS, JSON, and Markdown Support
    - Implementation of parsers and formatters for CSS, JSON, and Markdown.
    - Lint rules for CSS.

[patterns]
• Incremental Development:
    - Features like the formatter and LSP were gradually developed and improved over multiple commits.
    - This demonstrates a focus on iterative development and regular releases.
• Focus on Performance:
    - Several commits aimed at optimizing performance (e.g., printer source map, code action diff generation).
    - This suggests a commitment to providing a fast and efficient developer experience.
• Prioritization of Testing and Correctness:
    - Introduction of snapshot tests and a Prettier compatibility test suite for the formatter.
    - Parser tests for ensuring correct AST generation.
    - Use of coverage tools to assess test thoroughness.
    - This highlights a strong emphasis on testing and maintaining code quality.
• Open Source Collaboration:
    - Many commits were from community contributors, demonstrating a healthy and active open-source community.
• Focus on Extensibility:
    - Introduction of macros for defining lint rules and AST node unions.
    - This indicates an intention to make the framework customizable and adaptable.
• Refactoring for Improved Codebase:
    - Several commits were dedicated to refactoring (e.g., `FormatLanguage` trait, diagnostics refactor).
    - This suggests a focus on maintaining a clean and manageable codebase.
• Automation for Development Workflow:
    - Code generation for formatter and documentation.
    - CI workflows for automated testing, benchmarking, and releases.
    - This emphasizes a commitment to streamlining the development process.
• Shift towards Stability:
    - Early commits focused on core features and infrastructure.
    - Later commits addressed stability and user experience, particularly in the CLI and LSP.
• Potential Technical Debt Indicator:
    - Early use of `println` and `dbg`, later removed, could indicate initial development haste or a need for more rigorous code review practices in early development phases.
