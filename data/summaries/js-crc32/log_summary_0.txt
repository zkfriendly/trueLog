[description]
This project is a library for working with CRC32 checksums, with a focus on performance and compatibility with different JavaScript environments.

[milestones]
• Initial Release (0.2.0): Basic CRC32 functionality with performance optimizations.
    - 8-step unroll implemented for performance.
• Performance Improvements (0.4.0, 1.0.0, 1.0.1):  Focus on checksum calculation speed.
    - Rolling checksums introduced.
    - `bstr` performance improvements.
• Infrastructure and Tooling (1.2.0): Improvements to testing and build processes.
    - Increased test timeouts for newer Node.js versions.
    - ESM build added.
• Bug Fixes (1.2.1): Addressing specific issues.
    - Fix for slice-by-16 for `buf` and `bstr`.
• Dependency Updates (1.1.0, 1.2.2, 1.2.3): Regular version bumps likely include dependency updates.
    - Pinned dependencies.

[patterns]
• Performance Optimization: Recurring theme throughout the project's history.
    - Evidence: Commits related to unrolling, rolling checksums, and `bstr` performance.
    - Impact: Improved efficiency of CRC32 calculations.
• Platform Compatibility: Efforts to support different JavaScript environments.
    - Evidence: Node.js version updates in testing, AMD support, IE7/IE8 tests, Buffer.from fix for Node 4.x.
    - Impact: Wider applicability of the library.
• Incremental Development: Features and improvements added gradually over time.
    - Evidence: Version bumps and specific feature additions.
    - Impact: Steady progress and manageable changes.
• Limited Testing Visibility: Early commits lack detailed test information.
    - Evidence: Initial commits mention tests but lack specifics. Later commits improve testing infrastructure.
    - Impact: Potential for undiscovered bugs in earlier versions.
• Maintenance and Updates: Ongoing effort to keep the project up-to-date.
    - Evidence: Version bumps, dependency updates, link replacements.
    - Impact: Ensures compatibility and addresses potential vulnerabilities.
