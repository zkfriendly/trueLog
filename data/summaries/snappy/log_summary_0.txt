[description]
This project is a Node.js binding for the Snappy compression library. It provides methods for compressing and decompressing data using Snappy.

[milestones]
• Initial Implementation of Snappy Compression and Decompression (June 2021)
    - Implemented core compress and uncompress functions.
    - Added basic documentation and tests.
• Upgrade to N-API 2 (November 2021)
    - Improved performance and compatibility.
• Various Performance Improvements and Bug Fixes (2021-2025)
    - Addressed memory leaks.
    - Optimized buffer handling to avoid unnecessary copying.
    - Switched to mimalloc as the global allocator.
    - Fixed compatibility issues across different operating systems (FreeBSD, CentOS, Void Linux).
• Electron Compatibility Update (October 2022)
    - Provided copyOutputData to ensure compatibility with Electron versions 21 and above.


[patterns]
• Consistent Dependency Updates (ongoing)
    - Renovate bot regularly updates dependencies, indicating good maintenance practices.
    - Dependencies like esbuild, yarn, and various GitHub actions are kept up-to-date.
• Focus on Performance Optimization (recurring)
    - Multiple commits address memory leaks and buffer handling.
    - Introduction of mimalloc demonstrates a focus on improving performance.
• Platform Compatibility Improvements (recurring)
    - Fixes for FreeBSD, CentOS, Void Linux, and aarch64-musl builds highlight efforts to ensure broad platform support.
• Reactive Bug Fixing (occasional)
    - Several commits fix bugs related to memory leaks, invalid input handling, and native binding package names.
• CI/CD Enhancements (occasional)
    - Improvements to CI/CD pipelines, including memory leak detection and fixing various build issues.
• Limited Feature Development (observed)
    - After the initial implementation, development primarily focused on maintenance, bug fixes, performance improvements, and compatibility.  No major new features are apparent in the log.
• Potential Technical Debt: Limited proactive code refactoring observed, reliance on automated dependency updates without thorough review.
