[description]
The project is py.test, a testing framework for Python.  The logs show development activity focused on a transition away from setuptools, improvements to the plugin system, documentation enhancements using Sphinx and Pygments, distributed testing features, and significant refactoring for version 1.0.

[milestones]
• Transition from setuptools to a different build system
    - Motivated by ongoing problems with setuptools.
• Plugin System Overhaul
    - Renamed and refactored plugin-related objects.
    - Introduced a new PluginAPI and MultiAPI for managing plugin calls.
    - Shifted to keyword arguments for plugin calls.
    - Introduced pytest_item_makereport hook for xfail plugin.
    - Implemented a mechanism to exclude results from other plugins.
    - Added a -p option to add plugins from the command line.
• Documentation with Sphinx and Pygments
    - Switched to Sphinx for documentation generation.
    - Used Pygments for syntax highlighting of Python code and console output.
• Distributed Testing Enhancements
    - Implemented "--dist=each" to distribute tests to each available node.
    - Improved node management and result reporting.
    - Added the ability to send a test item to multiple nodes.
    - Introduced options like --hosts (later renamed --gateways) and --rsyncdirs.
• Refactoring for 1.0
    - Removal of global setupstate.
    - Introduction of py.test.collect.File.
    - Renaming of py.test.keywords to py.test.mark.
    - Internal renaming and cleanup of events and plugin calls.
• Twisted Plugin
    - Initial import of pytest_twisted plugin.
• Figleaf Plugin
    - Added pytest_figleaf plugin for code coverage.
    - Filtering of coverage for files outside tested package.

[patterns]
• Focus on Plugin Architecture:
    - Frequent renames, additions, and refactoring of plugin components.
    - Impact: Improved plugin API, more flexibility for extensions.
• Move towards Distributed Testing:
    - Implementation of distributed test execution and reporting features.
    - Impact: Enabled parallel test execution, scalable testing.
• Documentation Improvement:
    - Adoption of Sphinx and Pygments.
    - Rewriting and reorganizing documentation content.
    - Impact: Enhanced readability and navigability of documentation.
• Refactoring and Cleanup:
    - Removal of dead code, renames for consistency, and streamlining of internal calls.
    - Impact: Improved code maintainability and reduced technical debt.
• Addressing Technical Debt:
    - Explicit effort to remove old, unused, or problematic code (e.g., setuptools, global setupstate).
    - Impact: Improved long-term stability and maintainability.
• Cross-Python Compatibility:
    - Fixes and tests to ensure compatibility across different Python versions (2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6).
    - Impact: Broader user base and platform support.
• Windows Support Improvements:
    - Specific fixes for issues on Windows related to terminal, paths, and execnet.
    - Impact: Better support for Windows developers.
• Performance Optimization:
    - Focus on reducing tracing overhead and avoiding unnecessary operations.
    - Impact: Faster test execution.
