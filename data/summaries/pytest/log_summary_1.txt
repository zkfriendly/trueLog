[description]
This project is pytest, a mature Python testing framework. The analyzed commit logs reveal a strong focus on improving typing, code cleanup, performance optimization, and documentation enhancements alongside the deprecation of older features, paving the way for future versions.  Several bug fixes and minor feature additions are also present.

[milestones]
• Typing Improvements
    - Extensive addition of type annotations across various modules, including core, testing, and plugin components.
    - Improvements for type checking compatibility with different Python versions and tools like mypy.
• Code Cleanup and Refactoring
    - Removal of dead code, simplification of logic, and improvement of code style in various areas, including capturing, terminal reporting, and assertion rewriting.
    - Removal of obsolete compatibility code for Python 2 and older pytest versions.
• Performance Optimizations
    - Micro-optimizations targeting specific areas like node attribute access and expression compilation for -k/-m options.
    - Caching strategies to speed up collection and other operations.
• Documentation Enhancements
    - Clarification and correction of documentation across multiple sections, especially regarding hooks, fixtures, and reporting.
    - Use of pygments for code highlighting in the documentation.
