[description]
Boa is a JavaScript engine written in Rust. The project aims to create a high-performance, embeddable JavaScript engine.

[milestones]
• Implementation of a bytecode interpreter and virtual machine.
    - This enabled Boa to execute JavaScript code, marking a significant step towards a working engine.
• Introduction of a new garbage collector.
    - Replaced the previous GC with an ephemeron-based implementation, potentially improving performance and memory management.
• Overhaul of the object model.
    - Includes support for hidden classes and a type-safe root shape, likely enhancing object access and manipulation speed.
• Implementation of various built-in objects and their methods.
    - Includes `Array`, `String`, `Object`, `Map`, `Set`, `Proxy`, `Promise`, `Intl`, `Temporal`, etc. providing essential JavaScript functionality.
• Restructuring of the repository into a workspace.
    - This likely improved code organization and maintainability.
• Development of a CLI application (`boa_cli`).
    - Offers a REPL and script execution capabilities.
• Implementation of a simple module loader.
    - Enables the use of modules in Boa.
• Integration of ICU4X for internationalization support.
    - Allows for locale-specific operations.
• Development of `boa_tester`, a tool for running Test262 tests.
    - Ensures conformance with the ECMAScript specification.
• Continuous integration improvements, including cross-platform testing and benchmarking.
    - Helps maintain code quality and identify performance regressions.

[patterns]
• Regular dependency updates and security audits via Dependabot.
    - Demonstrates a focus on keeping dependencies up-to-date and addressing potential vulnerabilities.
• Focus on performance optimization.
    - Examples include using `ThinVec` for object representation, direct array element access, and constant folding optimization.
• Refactoring of core components like the object model and VM for improved design and efficiency.
    - Indicates a commitment to long-term maintainability and performance.
• Continuous integration is used extensively, including testing on different platforms and regular benchmarks with criterion.
    - Supports the project's focus on performance and cross-platform compatibility.
• Active development of `boa_tester` with regular updates to the test262 suite.
    - Reflects a commitment to ECMAScript conformance.
• Gradual implementation of ECMAScript features and built-in objects.
    - Suggests a methodical approach to development, prioritizing core features and gradually adding more complex ones.
• Extensive use of feature flags.
    - Enables experimental features to be tested without affecting the stability of the main codebase.
• Thorough documentation.
    - Suggests an emphasis on making the engine easy to understand and use.
• Active community involvement, with contributions from a diverse set of developers.
    - Indicates a healthy and growing open-source project.
• Shift towards using more idiomatic Rust features (e.g., let-else, ok_or_else).
    - Suggests ongoing efforts to improve code readability and maintainability.
• Potential technical debt in older parts of the codebase where less idiomatic Rust patterns might still exist.
    - Further refactoring might be needed in the future to address this.
