[description]
Hardhat deployment plugin for managing contract deployments and simplifying upgrades.

[milestones]
• zkSync Network Support
    - Added hardhat signer and provider for zkSync.
    - Updated deployment process for zkSync compatibility.
    - Introduced deterministic deployment and custom data for zkSync.
    - Fixed issues related to factory dependencies and re-deployment in zkSync.
• Improved Etherscan Verification
    - Added support for various Etherscan networks (Arbitrum Goerli, Optimism Goerli/Mainnet, Moonriver, Snowtrace, BscScan, PolygonScan, Cronos, Huobi Eco Chain, etc.).
    - Introduced the --contract-name option for specifying contract names during verification.
    - Added options for specifying API URLs and handling verification failures.
• Enhanced Proxy Support
    - Implemented support for UUPS proxies, including custom upgrade functions and deterministic deployments.
    - Added the ability to specify implementation names for reusing implementations across multiple proxies.
    - Fixed issues related to proxy dependencies and re-deployment checks.
• Diamond Pattern Support
    - Added support for deploying and managing Diamond contracts.
    - Introduced deterministic deployment for Diamond contracts.
    - Implemented filtering of selectors by facets in Diamonds.
• Ledger Hardware Wallet Support
    - Integrated support for Ledger hardware wallets, including path support and handling connection issues.
• Exporting Artifacts and Deployments
    - Implemented exporting artifacts and deployments, including support for TypeScript const export.
    - Added options for preserving directory structure and filtering exported artifacts.
• Improved Logging and Debugging
    - Introduced more detailed logging and debugging output, including transaction hashes and gas estimates.
    - Added the HARDHAT_DEPLOY_LOG environment variable for controlling log output.
• Companion Networks
    - Implemented companion networks for running tasks on different networks.

[patterns]
• Active Development and Community Contributions
    - Regular releases and consistent updates indicate active development.
    - Numerous pull requests from external contributors demonstrate a strong community involvement.
• Focus on Cross-Chain Compatibility
    - Frequent additions of support for various networks (zkSync, Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, BSC, etc.) suggest a focus on cross-chain compatibility.
• Addressing Technical Debt
    - Refactoring and code cleanup efforts, such as fixing typos, removing redundant code, and upgrading dependencies, indicate attention to technical debt.
• Emphasis on Deterministic Deployments
    - Several updates focused on ensuring deterministic deployments, particularly for proxies and diamond contracts, highlight the importance of predictable deployment addresses.
• Iterative Improvement of Features
    - Features like proxy support and diamond management have been progressively improved over time, suggesting an iterative development approach.
    - The addition of custom data/arguments and upgrade function options for proxies demonstrates this pattern.
• Growing Complexity
    - The addition of support for more complex patterns like diamond and proxies, along with numerous network integrations, suggests increasing complexity of the plugin.
    - This may require increased attention to maintainability and documentation.
• Potential for Feature Creep
    - The wide range of features and network integrations might lead to feature creep. Careful consideration should be given to the scope and complexity of future additions.
