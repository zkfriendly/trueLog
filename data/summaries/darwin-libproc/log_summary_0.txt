A library providing access to process information on macOS.

[milestones]
• Initial Release
    - Basic process information retrieval functions (proc_version, proc_pidpath, proc_name, proc_listpids).
• macOS Bindings Generation
    - Automated bindings generation for macOS 10.13 using bindgen.
• Expanded API Coverage
    - Added functions for pid_cwd, pid_rusage, and access to proc_bsdinfo via proc_pidinfo.
    - Constants from proc_info.h made available.

[patterns]
• Incremental API Expansion
    - Initial release provided basic functionality, with subsequent commits adding more specialized process information retrieval functions.
    - Suggests ongoing development and potential for future feature additions.
• Focus on Platform Compatibility
    - Explicit support for macOS 10.13 added via bindgen.
    - Indicates a dedication to maintaining compatibility across different macOS versions.
• Documentation and Testing Improvements
    - Updates to documentation links, additional documentation, and test coverage for pid lists.
    - Demonstrates a commitment to code quality and maintainability.
• Potential Technical Debt
    - Early commits lack comprehensive testing. While later commits address some testing gaps, there's a possibility of uncovered areas needing attention.
    - "Structs re-export" commit message is vague, suggesting potential code organization issues that could benefit from more detailed explanation.
