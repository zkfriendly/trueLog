[description]
A Node.js module for loading environment variables from .env files. Supports various features like custom paths, multi-line values, comments, different file encodings, and error handling.

[milestones]
• Multi-line value support (v14.3.0, Jan 2022)
    - Added the `multiline` option to handle values spanning multiple lines. Simplified in later versions to be enabled by default.
• Error code introduction (v14.0.0, Jan 2022)
    - Introduced error codes for better error handling and debugging. Improved logging detail in debug mode.
• Override option (v14.1.0, Jan 2022)
    - Added the `override` option to control how environment variables are set or overridden.
• Support for .env.vault files (v16.1.0-rc1, April 2023)
    - Added support for encrypted .env.vault files, presumably for enhanced security.
• Introduction of `populate` function (v16.1.0-rc2, May 2023)
    - Added the `populate` function (initially named `apply`) to parse and fill environment variables into a target object.
• Deprecation of dotenv-vault in favor of dotenvx (June 2024)
    - References to dotenv-vault replaced with dotenvx, potentially for a more integrated or maintained solution.
• Test coverage and dependency updates (Ongoing)
    - Continuous improvements to test coverage, dependency updates, and documentation.

[patterns]
• Incremental feature additions and improvements
    - Features like multi-line support, error codes, and override options were added incrementally.
• Community contributions
    - Several pull requests from external contributors demonstrate active community involvement in bug fixes, documentation improvements, and feature additions.
• Focus on improving developer experience
    - Enhancements like clearer error messages, simplified usage, and TypeScript type definitions indicate a focus on enhancing the developer experience.
• Security considerations
    - Support for .env.vault and the deprecation of dotenv-vault in favor of dotenvx suggest attention towards secure environment variable management.
• Addressing technical debt
    - Dependency updates, removal of deprecated features, and test coverage improvements indicate efforts to address technical debt.
• Shift to GitHub Actions for CI/CD (May 2023)
    - Migration from Travis CI and AppVeyor to GitHub Actions demonstrates a move towards a more modern CI/CD platform.
