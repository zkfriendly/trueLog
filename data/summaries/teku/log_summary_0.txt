[description]
Teku, a Java-based Ethereum client, is undergoing continuous development to support the latest Ethereum 2.0 upgrades and enhance its performance, stability, and functionality.  Development efforts focus on implementing new features like Deneb/EIP-4844 and preparing for future upgrades like Electra and Capella, while simultaneously improving core components such as networking, storage, the validator client, and the API.  Performance optimization, refactoring, and adherence to standards are also key priorities.

[milestones]
• Standards and API Improvements: Transition to a standardized API for various endpoints, including validator duties, block submission, attestation aggregation, and network management. Implementation of new endpoints for spec compliance and improved functionality.
• Enhanced Networking: Integration of discv5 discovery, improved peer management, connection stability, and request throttling. Support for gossipsub 1.1 and snappy compression.  Enhanced IPv6 support in discovery and libp2p.
• Improved Storage: Introduction of RocksDB as the default database, support for multiple database versions, and efficient state and block storage and retrieval. Implementation of pruning strategies for hot and finalized states and different storage modes.
• Validator Client Development: Implementation of validator duties, local signing, slashing protection, and remote validator API support. Transition towards independent validator timing and management. Implemented blinded block handling and MEV-Boost integration via the builder API. Improved validator registration, duty scheduling, and status reporting. Added support for external signers, including authentication and BLS key management.
• Deneb/EIP-4844 Support: Implemented blob sidecar handling in RPC methods, P2P gossip, and storage. Integrated KZG cryptography for blob commitments and proofs. Introduced new data structures and endpoints related to blobs and KZG. Refactored block production and publishing flows for Deneb.
• Capella Transition: Updated state and block structures with Capella-specific fields (e.g., withdrawals, BLS to execution changes). Implemented Capella-related API endpoints and updated existing ones. Added support for Capella reference tests. Integrated BLS change operations and withdrawal processing.
• Electra Preparations: Introduced data structures and config parameters for Electra (e.g., consolidation requests, single attestations). Modified epoch and block processing logic for Electra. Disabled Electra-specific code paths when not on the Electra network.
• Performance Optimizations: Reduction of BeaconState memory footprint, optimized BLS verification, and asynchronous processing of various tasks.  Recurring commits address performance bottlenecks in different areas (e.g., block processing, SSZ serialization).
• General Improvements: Upgraded dependencies (e.g., Besu, Netty, Jackson). Improved logging, metric tracking, and error reporting. Refactored code for improved performance, maintainability, and clarity.

[patterns]
• Focus on Standardization: A clear shift towards adhering to standard API specifications and best practices. This improves interoperability and reduces technical debt.
• Performance and Stability Improvements: Recurring themes of optimizing performance, improving connection stability, and reducing memory usage indicate a focus on creating a robust and efficient client.
• Incremental Development and Testing: Frequent small commits and the addition of unit and integration tests alongside new features demonstrate a commitment to code quality and a test-driven approach. Frequent updates to reference tests and integration tests for new features and upgrades.
• Refactoring and Code Cleanup: Regular code cleanup, refactoring, and dependency updates demonstrate a dedication to maintaining code quality and reducing technical debt. Addressing technical debt through refactoring efforts and cleanup of deprecated code and unused dependencies.
• Transition to Async Operations: Increasing use of asynchronous operations for various tasks suggests a focus on improving responsiveness and resource utilization.
• Enhanced Logging and Metrics: Improvements to logging and metrics provide better insights into node operation and performance, contributing to better monitoring and debugging. Numerous commits improve logging and metric tracking for better monitoring and debugging.
• Proactive Dependency Management: Regular dependency updates, including security patches and new feature releases. Promotes stability and incorporates external improvements.
• Focus on Deneb/EIP-4844: Numerous commits address blob sidecar handling, KZG integration, and related RPC methods. Suggests a strong prioritization of the Deneb upgrade.
• Transition to a More Modular Architecture: Extraction of specific functionalities into separate modules (e.g., execution client logic). Enhances code organization and maintainability.
