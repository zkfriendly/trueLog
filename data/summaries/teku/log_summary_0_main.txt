[description]
Teku is a Java-based Ethereum client supporting Beacon Chain and validator functionalities.  The analyzed logs span several months of development, showcasing active progress on various fronts, including performance enhancements, new feature implementations, dependency updates, bug fixes, and refactoring efforts. A significant focus has been directed towards the Deneb/EIP-4844 upgrade, encompassing blob sidecars, KZG cryptography, and related RPC methods and gossip topics. The transition to Capella and preparations for Electra are also evident, with changes to state/block structures, validator exits/consolidations, and API endpoints.  Further effort has gone into improving the validator client, particularly around blinded blocks and builder API integration for MEV-Boost.  Finally, general improvements such as enhanced IPv6 support, improved logging, and metric tracking are also present.

[milestones]
• Deneb/EIP-4844 Support
    - Implemented blob sidecar handling in RPC methods, P2P gossip, and storage.
    - Integrated KZG cryptography for blob commitments and proofs.
    - Introduced new data structures and endpoints related to blobs and KZG.
    - Refactored block production and publishing flows for Deneb.
• Capella Transition
    - Updated state and block structures with Capella-specific fields (e.g., withdrawals, BLS to execution changes).
    - Implemented Capella-related API endpoints and updated existing ones.
    - Added support for Capella reference tests.
    - Integrated BLS change operations and withdrawal processing.
• Electra Preparations
    - Introduced data structures and config parameters for Electra (e.g., consolidation requests, single attestations).
    - Modified epoch and block processing logic for Electra.
    - Disabled Electra specific code paths when not on Electra network.
• Validator Client Enhancements
    - Implemented blinded block handling and MEV-Boost integration via builder API.
    - Improved validator registration, duty scheduling, and status reporting.
    - Added support for external signers, including authentication and BLS key management.
• General Improvements
    - Enhanced IPv6 support in discovery and libp2p.
    - Implemented block pruning strategies for different storage modes.
    - Upgraded dependencies (e.g., Besu, Netty, Jackson).
    - Improved logging, metric tracking, and error reporting.
    - Refactored code for improved performance, maintainability, and clarity.
