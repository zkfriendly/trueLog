[patterns]
* Regular Dependency Updates: Frequent commits from dependabot and workflow bots keep dependencies up-to-date, reducing vulnerabilities.
* Focus on Performance Improvement: Recurring commits aimed at speeding up spell checking, suggestions, and trie lookups are important for usability, especially with large files and dictionaries.
* Integration Testing: Ongoing addition and maintenance of integration tests demonstrate a commitment to ensuring compatibility with various projects.
* Documentation Updates: Regular improvements and additions to documentation enhance user experience and understanding of the project.
* Refactoring and Code Quality: Several commits addressing code quality, refactoring, and linting indicate a focus on maintainability and reducing technical debt.
* Increased use of CI/CD Automation: Introduction and refinement of automated workflows for dependency updates, testing, and publishing streamlines development processes.
* Community Contributions: Merged pull requests from external contributors, including dictionary additions and documentation improvements, show community engagement and broaden project support.
* Shift to Monorepo: Consolidation of related packages into a single monorepo simplifies dependency management and code sharing.
* Transition towards ESM Modules: Modernization effort to adopt newer JavaScript module standards.
