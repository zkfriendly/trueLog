[patterns]
• Frequent Dependency Updates
    - Regular updates to packages like `eccrypto`, `enc-utils`, `bignumber.js`, `bn.js`, `web3-provider-engine`, etc.
    - Impact: Indicates active maintenance and dependency management, but also a potential source of instability if updates introduce breaking changes.
• Focus on Mobile Integration
    - Significant development effort dedicated to mobile deep linking, UI improvements for mobile, and expanding the mobile wallet registry.
    - Impact: Prioritizes mobile user experience and broadens wallet compatibility.
• Emphasis on Performance and Bundle Size Optimization
    - Migration to Preact, removal of unnecessary dependencies, and bundle size analysis reflect a focus on performance.
    - Impact: Improves loading times and overall user experience.
• Refactoring and Code Quality
    - Recurring refactoring efforts, linting, and unit testing demonstrate attention to code quality.
    - Impact: Enhances maintainability and reduces the risk of bugs.
• Feature-Driven Development
    - Many commits introduce or improve user-facing features like QR code modal, multi-wallet support, and i18n.
    - Impact:  Delivers value to end-users but may also lead to technical debt if not balanced with architectural improvements.
• Addressing Technical Debt
    - Several commits specifically address technical debt by refactoring code, updating dependencies, and improving error handling.
    - Impact: Shows a commitment to long-term maintainability and stability.
• Shift towards Modularization
    - Decoupling of transport from core, separation of web3 provider and subprovider, and creation of independent packages improve modularity.
    - Impact: Enhances code organization, reusability, and testability.
