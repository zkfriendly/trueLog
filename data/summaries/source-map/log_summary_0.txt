[description]
A JavaScript library for working with source maps.

[milestones]
• Addition of source map specification tests
    - Added a test harness for source map spec tests.
    - Included tests for transitive mappings.
    - Integrated existing source map tests.
• Improvement of performance in certain situations
    - SourceMapConsumer now sorts generated and original mappings on demand.
• Implementation of core source map features
    - Implemented SourceMapConsumer.prototype.computeColumnSpans.
    - Implemented SourceMapConsumer.allGeneratedPositionsFor.
    - Added support for mapping from original to generated positions.
• Rewriting performance-critical parts in Rust and WebAssembly
    - Implemented VLQ decoding in WebAssembly for improved performance.
    - Provided asynchronous initialization for WebAssembly module.
• Upgrade to WebAssembly based mappings
    - Replaced JavaScript QuickSort with Rust/WebAssembly implementation.
    - Optimized base64 decoding using WebAssembly.

[patterns]
• Focus on Performance Optimization
    - Several commits aimed at improving parsing speed and memory usage.
    - Use of WebAssembly demonstrates a commitment to leveraging performance optimization techniques.
• Addressing Technical Debt
    - Refactoring of internal data structures and comparators suggests efforts to reduce technical debt and improve maintainability.
• Incremental Feature Development
    - Source map specification tests were added incrementally, starting with a draft and refining it based on feedback.
• Community Contributions and Code Reviews
    - Pull requests and code reviews indicate an active community and a focus on code quality.
    - Contributions from various developers show a diverse range of perspectives and expertise.
• Continuous Integration and Automated Testing
    - Use of Travis CI and later GitHub Actions reflects a strong emphasis on automated testing and continuous integration.
• Focus on Code Quality and Maintainability
    - Adoption and enforcement of linting and code formatting rules (Prettier, ESLint) ensures consistent code style and reduces code quality issues.
• Attention to Edge Cases and Error Handling
    - Commits addressing specific bugs, such as off-by-one errors and handling of null values, show a dedication to thorough testing and robust error handling.
• Transition to Modern Tooling and Dependencies
    - Shift from Dryice to Webpack for builds and the upgrade to GitHub Actions for CI demonstrate a commitment to keeping up-to-date with modern development tools.
