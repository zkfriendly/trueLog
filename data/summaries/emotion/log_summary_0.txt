[description]
This project is the Emotion JavaScript library, a performant and flexible CSS-in-JS library. The commit logs span a period of active development, showcasing the evolution of the library through various feature additions, bug fixes, performance improvements, and a significant migration to TypeScript.

[milestones]
• TypeScript Migration
    - Several core packages, including `@emotion/styled`, `@emotion/react`, `@emotion/cache`, and others, were converted from JavaScript to TypeScript. This enhances type safety, improves developer experience, and contributes to better code maintainability.
• Emotion 11 Release
    - This major release introduces several breaking changes and new features, including changes to the JSX runtime, enhancements to label extraction, improvements to the style minifier, and several bug fixes.
• JSX Runtime and CSS Prop Optimization
    - New JSX entry points were introduced for the automatic runtime, impacting how JSX is handled within Emotion. Changes were made to CSS prop optimization, including making `cssPropOptimization` default to true.
• Stylis Upgrade
    - Stylis, the CSS preprocessor used by Emotion, was upgraded to version 4, which introduced container queries support and other improvements. This also involved forking the Stylis prefixer to have better control over prefixing logic.
• Improved Label Extraction and Source Maps
    - The process of extracting labels from stack traces for improved debugging was enhanced, with fixes for various edge cases and better handling of different browsers. Source map generation and integration were also improved for easier debugging and development.
• New Documentation and Website
    - The project documentation and website received updates, including a switch to MDX, grammar corrections, and the addition of new sections like "Best Practices".
