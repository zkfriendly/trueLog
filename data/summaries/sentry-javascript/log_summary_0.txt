[patterns]
• Deprecation and Removal of Legacy Code
    - Consistent effort to remove deprecated code and simplify the SDK.
    - Clear migration guides provided to help users transition to newer versions.
    - Impact: Reduces technical debt and improves maintainability.
• Transition to Functional Integrations
    - Shift from class-based integrations to functional integrations.
    - Impact: Simplifies the SDK and potentially reduces bundle size.
• Increased Use of OpenTelemetry
    - Greater reliance on OpenTelemetry for tracing and performance monitoring.
    - Impact: Improves interoperability with other OpenTelemetry-based systems.
• Focus on Performance and Bundle Size Optimization
    - Numerous changes aimed at optimizing performance and reducing bundle size.
    - Size limit checks added to CI to ensure bundles stay within reasonable limits.
    - Impact: Improves user experience and reduces resource consumption.
• Improved Testing and CI
    - Transition to newer testing frameworks (e.g., Vitest, Playwright).
    - More comprehensive integration and E2E tests.
    - Improved CI workflows and caching.
    - Impact: Increases confidence in code quality and reduces development time.
• Focus on Developer Experience
    - Improved documentation, clearer error messages, and simplified APIs.
    - Impact: Makes the SDK easier to use and integrate into projects.
• Breaking Changes Introduced with Major Version Bump (v9)
    - Significant API changes and removal of legacy features.
    - Impact: Requires users to update their code when migrating to v9.
    - Mitigation: Detailed migration guides provided to ease the transition.
• Security Improvements (e.g., CSP, Masking)
