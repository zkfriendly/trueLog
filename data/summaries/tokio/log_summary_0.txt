[description]
Tokio, an asynchronous runtime for Rust, focuses on fast performance, reliability, and scalability.  This commit log reflects development spanning approximately one year, capturing work on the runtime, networking, synchronization primitives, file system operations, and task management.

[milestones]
• Stabilization of core task APIs: task::Id, JoinSet, AbortHandle, consume_budget. These additions give developers more control over task management, cancellation, and cooperative scheduling.
• Introduction of new threaded runtime with self-tuning capabilities and a LIFO slot optimization. This significantly changed Tokio's internal architecture, aiming for better performance and scalability.
• Implementation of AsyncFd for improved low-level I/O interactions. This offers a more flexible and efficient mechanism to interact with file descriptors asynchronously.
• Introduction of task hooks and runtime metrics. These tools give developers insights into the runtime's behavior, aiding in performance analysis and optimization.
• Addition of various synchronization primitives: Mutex::blocking_lock_owned, PollSemaphore::poll_acquire_many, watch::Sender::send_modify, watch::Receiver::wait_for, CancellationToken. These address a wider range of concurrency scenarios, providing safer ways for tasks to synchronize and manage resources.
• Expansion of file system APIs with vectored writes, AsyncSeek, and convenience functions. This made file interactions in Tokio more comprehensive and efficient.
• Enhanced networking capabilities: UdpSocket::peek, conversions for Unix SocketAddr, SimplexStream, AsyncRead/Write passthrough for Inspect. This broadened Tokio's networking capabilities, especially for Unix sockets.
• Introduction of task dumps for improved debugging and diagnostics. These snapshots provide detailed information about the state of tasks, helping identify deadlocks and other issues.
• Migration to Mio v1 and Bytes v1.  This signified updates to core dependencies, likely requiring some internal refactoring and API adjustments.
• Cooperative scheduling improvements in sync primitives (e.g., broadcast::Receiver, watch). This optimizes performance by reducing context switches when possible.
• Enhanced testing and CI infrastructure: Miri integration, spellchecking, ASAN, semver checks. This reinforces Tokio's commitment to stability and correctness.
• Documentation improvements.  This addresses a key aspect of project maintenance, making the library easier to use and understand.


[patterns]
• Continuous optimization of performance and scalability. Evidence: introduction of new runtime, LIFO slot optimization, cooperative scheduling improvements, IO driver improvements. Impact: improved throughput and resource utilization.
• Focus on API stabilization and enhancing developer experience. Evidence: stabilization of core APIs, improved documentation and error messages, addition of convenience functions, task hooks, runtime metrics. Impact: improved usability and predictability.
• Increased utilization of the tracing crate for instrumentation. Evidence: tracing spans for various operations, migration away from log crate. Impact: improved observability and debugging capabilities.
• Proactive addressing of technical debt. Evidence: rewriting core components like the I/O driver and using intrusive linked lists, refactoring and simplifying internal code, upgrading to newer dependency versions. Impact: improved maintainability and reduced risk of future issues.
• Strong focus on testing and correctness. Evidence: integration of Miri, fuzz testing, ASAN, race condition detection and fixes, extensive unit and integration tests. Impact: increased confidence in the reliability of the library.
• Gradual shift towards async/await syntax. Evidence: rewriting examples and some internal components with async/await. Impact: more idiomatic and readable code.
• Community involvement. Evidence: addressing issues and merging pull requests from external contributors. Impact: broader adoption and diverse perspectives.
• Prioritization of cancel safety and resource leak prevention. Evidence: documentation of cancel safety, addition of AbortOnDropHandle, fixing memory leaks. Impact: increased robustness and reliability.
