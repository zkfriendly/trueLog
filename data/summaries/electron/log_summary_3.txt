    - Added new documentation for APIs like the Notification API, Touch Bar API, and BrowserView API.
• Focus on cross-platform compatibility
    - Many commits address platform-specific issues and aim to make Electron behave more consistently across different operating systems.
• Dependency upgrades
    - Regular updates to Chromium, Node.js, and other dependencies, indicating an effort to keep Electron up-to-date with the latest versions.
•  Experimental feature implementation
    - Several new APIs and features, such as the BrowserView API, native window.open, and Touch Bar support, are marked as experimental.
• Deprecation of old APIs and introduction of new APIs for features like window styling, default protocols, and system preferences.
• Addressing security concerns by adding security warnings, enabling sandboxing in webviews, and improving permission handling.
• Focus on performance by implementing changes to avoid idle wakeups on Windows, enabling off-screen rendering, and improving garbage collection.
