    - Transition from older data structures and algorithms to newer, more efficient ones.

patterns
• Focus on Proof-of-Stake Transition and Upcoming Upgrades: The majority of commits relate to implementing and testing features for upgrades like Electra, Deneb, and Capella, showcasing a strong focus on the proof-of-stake transition and its associated features like blobs, withdrawals, and proposer/builder separation.
    - Evidence: Numerous commits related to Electra/Deneb/Capella consensus logic, data structures, networking, RPC/API, and testing.
    - Impact: Enables participation in the evolving Ethereum network and its new functionality.
• Continuous Improvement of Performance and Code Quality: Recurring themes include code cleanup, refactoring, optimization, and testing improvements, suggesting an ongoing effort to improve codebase maintainability and performance.
    - Evidence: Commits related to code refactoring, optimization of core processes, introduction of caches, and expansion of test coverage.
    - Impact: Leads to a more robust, performant, and maintainable codebase.
• Proactive Technical Debt Management: Deprecations and removals indicate a focus on reducing technical debt and simplifying the codebase.
    - Evidence: Commits removing deprecated flags, endpoints, and code.
    - Impact: Reduces complexity and improves maintainability for long-term development.
• Strong Emphasis on Testing and Correctness: The significant investment in testing, including new tests, spec test integration, and addressing flaky tests, demonstrates a commitment to ensuring the correctness and stability of the software.
    - Evidence: Commits related to expanding test coverage, integrating spec tests, and fixing flaky tests.
    - Impact: Increases confidence in the reliability and security of the software.
• Shifting Development Focus Based on Upgrade Timeline: The commits reflect shifts in development focus corresponding to the timelines of different upgrades, with initial emphasis on the Merge followed by work on subsequent upgrades.
