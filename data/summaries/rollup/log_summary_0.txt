[description]
Rollup, a JavaScript module bundler, underwent significant development with a focus on performance enhancements, new features like JSX support, improved developer experience with an enhanced REPL and detailed error messages, and a major architectural shift towards native/WASM code with the adoption of the SWC parser.

[milestones]
• Rollup 4.0: Introduced SWC parser and native/WASM code, marking a major architectural change, impacting performance and potentially plugin compatibility.
• JSX Support (4.24.0): Introduced JSX support, expanding Rollup's capabilities for modern JavaScript development.
• Enhanced REPL: Multiple improvements to the REPL, including support for logging, better colors, and more available options, improved developer experience.
• Detailed Error Messages & Locations: Enhanced error messages with location information and improved logging for better debugging.
• Performance Enhancements: Continuous focus on performance optimizations, especially in chunking and module resolution.
• Improved Documentation: Revamped website using Vitepress, improved architecture documentation, and ongoing refinements.
• Enhanced Tree-shaking: ongoing refinements and bug fixes to tree-shaking, leading to smaller bundle sizes.
• Support for New Syntax: Ongoing addition of support for modern JavaScript syntax like decorators, import assertions, and optional chaining.
• Wider Platform Support: Added support for more platforms like FreeBSD, Linux LoongArch, ppc64le, s390x.

[patterns]
• Regular Releases: Consistent releases indicate active maintenance and development.
• Performance Focus: Recurring performance improvements across different areas suggest a commitment to optimization.
• Community Contributions: Many commits from external contributors demonstrate a healthy and active community.
• Documentation Improvements: Regular documentation updates suggest a focus on user experience.
• Security Updates:  Security vulnerabilities are addressed promptly, showing attention to security best practices.
• Dependency Updates: Active dependency management with Renovate shows a focus on keeping dependencies up-to-date.
• Shift to Native Code: The introduction of the SWC parser and WASM code marks a strategic shift towards using native code, which has significant performance implications.
• Experimental Feature Introductions:  Incremental introduction of experimental features like minChunkSize and logging side effects allows for community feedback and iterative improvement.
• Addressing Technical Debt:  Refactoring efforts and code cleanups indicate a commitment to addressing technical debt, though potential for more remains in older parts of the codebase.
• Increased use of Rust:  Growing usage of Rust for core parts of the bundler shows a strategic investment in long-term performance and maintainability.
• Testing & Code Quality:  Comprehensive testing and linting practices, including the introduction of clippy, suggest a commitment to code quality.
