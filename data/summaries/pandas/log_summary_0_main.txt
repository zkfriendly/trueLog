[description]
This project focuses on enhancing Pandas, a Python data analysis library.  The commits address bugs, improve performance, enhance existing features, update documentation, and refactor code. A main theme observed involves enabling PyArrow backend and new string dtype for several functionalities. Another important aspect is the full implementation of Copy-on-Write and deprecation of related features and warnings.

[milestones]
• String dtype support
    - Implemented new string dtype backed by PyArrow for improved performance and compatibility.
    - Enabled string dtype support in various operations, I/O methods, and functions like merge, concat, groupby, etc.
    - Adjusted tests for new string dtype.

• Copy-on-Write (CoW) Implementation
    - Fully implemented Copy-on-Write, changing default copy behavior.
    - Introduced warning mode for potential CoW-related behavior changes.
    - Added ChainedAssignmentError for inplace operations under CoW.
    - Cleaned up CoW-related code and documentation.

• Python 3.12 Support
    - Added support for building and testing Pandas with Python 3.12.

• PyArrow integration and dependency upgrade
    - PyArrow set as a required dependency.
    - Expanded PyArrow backend support for functionalities like to_datetime, duration types, reductions, string operations.
    - Fixed related bugs and deprecations.
    
• Deprecations
    - Deprecated features like ArrayManager, delim_whitespace, use_inf_as_na, various nonkeyword and keyword arguments.
    - Deprecated warnings like SettingWithCopyWarning.
    - Enforced deprecations by changing FutureWarnings to DeprecationWarnings and raising errors.

• Performance Improvements
    - Improved performance in areas like groupby, reductions, string operations, array_strptime, DataFrame/Series construction, DataFrame.to_csv.
    - Added benchmarks for several operations.
    
• Numba engine for Groupby and apply
    - Added numba engine support to DataFrame.apply and GroupBy aggregations including support for returning non-float64 results.

[patterns]
• Focus on performance optimization
    - Evidence: Numerous performance-related commits addressing specific bottlenecks, introduction of new algorithms, and leveraging PyArrow for faster operations.
    - Impact: Enhanced efficiency in various functionalities, including groupby, reductions, and string operations.

• Increased use of PyArrow
    - Evidence: Many commits dedicated to integrating PyArrow functionality for various dtypes and operations. 
    - Impact: Improved string handling, better handling of various data types including timestamps and durations.

• Active code cleanup and refactoring
    - Evidence: Regular commits addressing code smells, removing deprecated code, de-duplicating logic, and improving type hints.
    - Impact: Improved maintainability, readability, and type safety of the codebase.

• Focus on documentation improvement and compliance to Numpy standards.
    - Evidence: Commits fixing docstrings, typos, examples, and enforcing Numpy docstring validation.
    - Impact: Enhanced clarity, accuracy, and consistency across the documentation.


• Transition to Meson build system.
    - Evidence: Commits related to setting up and adjusting meson build files.
    - Impact: Modernized build process and eliminated setup.py based builds.
