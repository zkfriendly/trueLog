[description]
This commit log represents a period of active development and maintenance within the Pandas project, primarily focused on code cleanup, performance enhancements, bug fixes, documentation improvements, and type hinting.  It also shows preparation for the 1.0 and 1.1 releases.

[milestones]
• Implementation of Nullable Dtypes: Introduction of nullable Float32/64 ExtensionArray and related features represent significant steps towards enhanced data handling capabilities.
• StringArray and IntegerArray Enhancements: Implementation of reductions and other operations for StringArray and IntegerArray expand the functionality of these dtypes.
• Performance Optimizations: Numerous commits address performance bottlenecks in various areas, including indexing, datetime operations, and reductions.  Block-wise operations and caching strategies are employed to achieve these gains.
• Groupby and Rolling Enhancements: Refinements to groupby and rolling operations, including new engine options and bug fixes, improve these core features. Numerical stability improvements for window functions, custom BaseIndexer support, and addressing level order inconsistency are noteworthy.
• Type Hinting: A significant number of commits are dedicated to type hinting across the codebase, improving maintainability and static analysis capabilities.
• Code Cleanup and Refactoring: Many commits focus on code cleanup, simplification, de-duplication, removal of unused code, and standardization of exception messages and function signatures.  Removal of the deprecated ix indexer is a major step in cleanup.
• Testing Improvements: Parametrization of tests, stricter assertions, and reorganization of test files enhance the robustness and coverage of the test suite. 
• Documentation Improvements:  Docstring fixes, updates to examples, and reorganization of sections are evident.

[patterns]
• Focus on Performance:  Recurring theme of improving performance in various operations suggests a priority on efficiency. Evidence includes implementation of block-wise operations and specialized fast paths.
• Type Hinting Prioritization:  Consistent addition of type hints indicates an emphasis on code quality and maintainability.  The gradual introduction suggests a systematic effort to improve code health.
• Increased Use of Pytest Idioms: The project is shifting towards greater use of fixtures and parameterized tests, improving test structure and efficiency.
• Modernization of Codebase: The removal of legacy code (ix indexer, Python 2 compatibility), upgrading minimum dependencies, and use of f-strings indicate a focus on modernizing the codebase.
• Addressing Technical Debt:  Refactoring efforts and simplification of complicated code paths demonstrate a commitment to reducing technical debt and improving maintainability.  This is most visible in the simplification of indexing and groupby/rolling internals.
• Towards More Robust Code:  Focus on stricter tests and edge case handling demonstrates a drive towards higher quality and reliability.  Efforts to standardize behaviors and exception types contribute to overall robustness.
• Transition to Public API Usage:  Refactoring efforts to replace internal API usage with public APIs wherever possible improve stability and maintainability.  This reduces the reliance on potentially volatile internal implementations.
