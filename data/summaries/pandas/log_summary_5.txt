[patterns]
• Focus on performance improvement
    - Cythonization of various functions, like GroupBy operations and rolling functions.
    - Optimization of specific operations like DatetimeIndex.time, NDFrame.describe, and MultiIndex operations.
    - Impact: Significant speed improvements in various areas of the library.
• API cleanup and consistency
    - Deprecation and removal of inconsistent or redundant functions and attributes, like .ix, .as_matrix, from_items, TimeGrouper, and various Panel methods.
    - Introduction of new, more consistent APIs like .agg/.aggregate and to_xarray.
    - Standardization of function signatures and keyword arguments.
    - Impact: A cleaner, more consistent, and easier-to-use API.
• Enhanced support for Categorical data
    - Several improvements and bug fixes related to CategoricalIndex, CategoricalDtype, and categorical data handling in various functions.
    - Introduction of union_categoricals.
    - Impact: Better support and performance for working with categorical data.
• Improved documentation
    - Extensive docstring updates, additions of examples, and corrections of typos and errors.
    - Updated contributing guidelines.
    - Impact: Clearer and more comprehensive documentation for users and contributors.
• Increased testing and compatibility
