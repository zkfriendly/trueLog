[description]
This commit log reflects development work on the Pandas library, focusing heavily on refactoring, deprecations, performance improvements, bug fixes, type annotations, and continuous integration enhancements.  The work appears to be in preparation for a major version 1.0.0 release, addressing technical debt and modernizing the codebase.

[milestones]
• Refactoring of pytables and groupby modules
    - Transitioning operations to DataFrames instead of Blocks
    - Simplifying internal logic and removing dead code
    - Cleaning up type annotations and docstrings
• Deprecation of legacy functionalities
    - Removal of various deprecated keywords, attributes and methods like `ix`, `get_values`, and various `to_` and `from_` methods
    - Standardizing API signatures and behavior
• Implementation of Extension Arrays
    - Introduction of new array types and associated operations
    - BooleanArray, StringArray, IntegerArray and others
    - Updating and standardizing array operations and interactions with other data structures
• Plotting backend abstraction
    - Decoupling plotting code from Matplotlib specifics
    - Enabling support for different plotting backends
• Type annotation and code cleanup
    - Adding type annotations across the codebase for improved maintainability and static analysis
    - Using f-strings for enhanced code readability
    - Simplifying and modernizing code throughout the library
