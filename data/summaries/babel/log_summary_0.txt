    - Several alpha releases (8.0.0-alpha.5 through 8.0.0-alpha.15) mark progress towards Babel 8.  These introduce significant changes, including removing legacy options, aligning with newer standards, and laying groundwork for full ESM support.
• Babel 7 Minor Releases:
    - Numerous minor releases of Babel 7 (7.21.x through 7.26.x) continue to provide bugfixes, performance enhancements, and compatibility updates.  Highlights include improvements to JSX transform, enhanced TypeScript support, optimized module transforms, and broader compatibility with Node.js versions.
• Decorators Update:
    - Support for the 2023-11 normative update for decorators is a significant feature addition, aligning Babel with the latest proposals.  Related changes include streamlining decorator helpers and optimizing performance.
• TypeScript Support Enhancements:
    - Ongoing improvements to TypeScript support, including updates for TS 5.x, improved type handling, better constant enum inlining, and support for newer TS features like satisfies expressions and variance annotations.
• Explicit Resource Management (ERM) Parsing and Transform:
    - Implementation of parsing and transform support for using declarations marks progress in adopting the explicit resource management proposal.  Updates include relaxing restrictions on using await and allowing lookup of Symbol.dispose.
• Performance Optimizations:
    - Several performance improvements across various areas, including scope information collection, module transforms, `@babel/types` builders, and generator performance.
• Flow Integration Updates:
    - Alignment of Flow plugin and preset behavior with evolving Flow language features, deprecation of older options, and enhancements to type handling.
• Tooling and Dependency Updates:
    - Migration to ESLint 9, upgrade to Yarn 4, updates to build tools (Rollup, Jest), and dependency bumps for several packages contribute to improved developer experience and project maintainability.
• Removal of Legacy Features and Options:
    - Removal of legacy options and features, such as minimal/smart pipelines and various deprecated methods, contributes to a leaner Babel 8.
