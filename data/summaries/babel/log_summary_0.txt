[description]
Babel is a JavaScript compiler ecosystem consisting of several interrelated projects:

* **Babel Compiler:** Transpiles ES6+ code into backwards-compatible ES5, supporting modern ECMAScript features, JSX, TypeScript, Flow, and experimental proposals.  It focuses on performance, error handling, and a modular architecture.
* **Babel ESLint Plugin:** Provides ESLint rules for Babel projects, ensuring code quality and compatibility with evolving JavaScript.
* **Babel Parser (Babylon):** A high-performance JavaScript parser supporting modern JavaScript features (ES6+, JSX), loose parsing modes, and utilities like an AST walker.

[milestones]

* **Babel Compiler:**
    * Babel 8: Alpha releases (8.0.0-alpha.5 to 8.0.0-alpha.15) introducing breaking changes, removing legacy options, and preparing for full ESM support.
    * Babel 7: Minor releases (7.21.x to 7.26.x) with bug fixes, performance enhancements, improved JSX/TypeScript/Node.js compatibility.
    * ES2016/ES2017 Support:  Async functions, object rest/spread, class properties, etc.
    * JSX, Flow, TypeScript: Enhanced support and ongoing improvements.
    * Tooling & Architecture: Babel CLI, plugin API, runtime transformation, core-js integration, monorepo structure (Lerna).
    * Decorators: Support for the 2023-11 normative update.
    * Explicit Resource Management (ERM): Parsing and transform support.

* **Babel ESLint Plugin:**
    * Versioned Releases: 1.0.0, 2.0.0, 3.0.0, and 4.0.0, with various patch releases.
    * Feature Additions: Flowtype plugin, improved code style rules, TypeScript type import support.
    * Tooling/Workflow: test262 integration, enhanced error handling, .cjs config file support, dependency cleanup (core-js), pipeline operator and TypeScript namespace support.

* **Babel Parser:**
    * Initial Import: Adapted from Esprima.
    * JSX Support: Parsing JSX syntax (namespaces, attributes, nesting).
    * ES6 Support: let/const, arrow functions, classes, template strings, generators, destructuring, spread operator, modules.
    * Loose Parser: Relaxed syntax rules and improved error recovery.
    * AST Walker: Utility for traversing and manipulating the AST.
    * Tooling/Infrastructure: Travis CI, Code Climate, Istanbul, improved documentation.


[patterns]
